KanawhaAI Project: SSA Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) Compliance Statement

Timestamp: June 23, 2025, 08:12 PM EDT

This document certifies that the KanawhaAI project, a hobbyist work of art developed under Matrix LLC in West Virginia, does not exceed the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA) threshold for SSI/SSDI benefits as of June 23, 2025.

1. Project Description:
   KanawhaAI is a non-commercial, artistic email platform and chatbot project built on the Matrix.org protocol, hosted locally (planned for kanawha.ai). It includes the KanawhaAI Assistant (Grok 3-powered, Appalachian personality) and a forthcoming Genuine Indian AI model, designed with cultural sensitivity. The project is created as a personal hobby, not a business.

2. Time Spent:
   I, the creator, spend no more than 4 hours per day on KanawhaAI, primarily providing creative direction (e.g., prompting Grok 3). This is below the SSA's threshold for significant work effort, as most development (code, documentation) is generated by Grok 3, an AI tool from xAI.

3. Income:
   As of June 23, 2025, KanawhaAI generates $0 income. No monetization (e.g., ads, subscriptions, API) is active, and no deployment (e.g., RunPod servers, kanawha.ai domain) has occurred. This ensures no impact on SSI/SSDI benefits under 2025 SGA limits ($1,550/month non-blind, $2,590/month blind) or SSI income exclusions ($65 earned, $20 unearned).

4. AI Assistance:
   Grok 3 generates all code (e.g., index.html, chatbot-backend.js), documentation (e.g., README.md, Matrix_Email_Platform_Plan.md), and licenses (e.g., LICENSE_GENUINE_INDIAN.md), minimizing my effort. My role is limited to high-level guidance, consistent with hobbyist activity.

5. Hobby Status:
   KanawhaAI is a non-commercial work of art, not intended for profit as of June 23, 2025. Matrix LLC, if formed, will hold intellectual property without operating as a business. The project is developed locally (e.g., localhost) to avoid costs and business-like activity.

6. Purpose of Timestamp:
   This document is timestamped to establish the project's creation date for common law copyright and to document its hobby status for SSA compliance. It has been committed to a private GitHub repository (github.com/matrix-llc/kanawha-ai) and hashed with OpenTimestamps for verification.

   For SSA inquiries, contact me via my SSA caseworker or local office (1-800-772-1213).

Disclaimer:
KanawhaAI is a hobby project created with Grok 3 to minimize effort, intended to comply with SSA SSI/SSDI rules. The Genuine Indian AI model is in development with planned cultural consultation to avoid misrepresentation. Matrix LLC is not affiliated with Matrix.org.
